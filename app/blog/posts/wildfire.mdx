Hey again, definately a human here, today, in the rantpaper, we're gonna be talking about what the hell is going on in the USA and why is it in flames.
So, here's LA's Palisades wildfire:

I cannot stress this enough, my heart goes out to the families affected in the wildfire, as this one has Officially been named the most destructive in LA history.
as of 10:26 Vilnius, Lithuania time around 10 minutes ago it has been confirmed that "winds are starting to intensify in LA as the wildfire death toll rises to 16." ouch....
As of right now, only about 11% of the fire has been contained, while the Eaton fire is only at 15%.
From the NY Times: "Los Angeles firefighters were [scrambling to contain several blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/11/us/los-angeles-fires-california#los-angeles-fires-affected-areas) as winds picked up on Saturday afternoon, threatening to further spread fires, as the death toll rose to 16 people.

The county’s medical examiner said late Saturday that 11 people have been killed
in the Eaton fire, near Pasadena, and five died in the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles."
Thanks NY, definately great progress.... And well, of course, even during tragedies, politics still find it's way thru to bullshit around the clock.
Critics of the California authorities say: "They did not do enough to warn residents about the fires or prepare resources to fight them. The most prominent one, President-elect Donald J. Trump, weighed in again early Sunday in a social media post."

And for trump: “The fires are still raging in L.A.,” wrote Trump, who [had previously blamed Governor Gavin Newsom](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/los-angeles-fires-trump-newsom.html) for failing to contain them.
“The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.” Yeah, still hate that guy, feel like he only ran to escape from jail

And for the government on the situation, Of Course theyre now making tours around the fires:
Gov. Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles have both invited Trump to tour the fire damage in the city. He has not responded publicly to the invitations.
